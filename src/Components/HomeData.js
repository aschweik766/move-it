      longDesc: "If you have low back pain, you are not alone. At any given time, about 25% of people in the United States report having low back pain within the past 3 months. In most cases, low back pain is mild and disappears on its own. For some people, back pain can return or hang on, leading to a decrease in quality of life or even to disability. Physical therapists help people with low back pain improve or restore mobility and reduce their pain. Physical therapists are movement experts. They improve quality of life through hands-on care, patient education, and prescribed movement. You can contact a physical therapist directly for an evaluation."

      longDesc:"Do you want to jump higher, run faster, and be able to move without pain? If you’re active and exercising regularly, the reason you may not be reaching your goals isn’t for lack of activity, but rather lack of mobility. Flexibility is the ability of your joints to move through their full range of motion without pain or stiffness. It also refers to the pliability of the muscles that support the joints. Flexible muscles and tendons allow for greater range of motion during activities. There are many exercises you can do to improve your flexibility, including stretching. Static stretching, or holding one position for an extended period, might be your preferred method of warming up before a workout. According to a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, it appears that dynamic stretching, or stretching while moving through a movement, is better than static stretching as part of a warmup. Just 10 minutes of a dynamic warmup prior to a workout is linked to improvements in shuttle run time, medicine ball throw distance, and jump distance.Try these five flexibility exercises to improve your joint flexibility and function so you can move better, allowing you to improve strength and performance during your next workout.",
