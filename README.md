# move-it HEP
A Physical Therapist's Personal Exercise and Home Exercise Plan library


# user stories
This was developed in mind with helping a PT's ability to share exercise documentation with patients during sessions more efficient. A user can search, select, print, and favorite exercises from this current library. The library was built by myself and a friend that is a PT, as we developed some custom date on several 'top' exercises she would like to share.
